# Simulated Annealing for optimization
Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is often used when the search space is discrete

optimized function : <br />
f(x1,x2 )= -(sin(x1)cos(x2 )+4/5 exp(1-âˆš(x1^2+x2^2 )))<br /><br />
for -10<x1<10 and -10<x2<10
